# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Firstly, when I start to do this challenge, I saw some repetition on the UI. So I decided to use JavaScript to avoid repetition. Even thought I decided to use JavaScript, I only use HTML and CSS and let repeat it due to my feeling. Cause at that time I felt headache.

# Thank you
